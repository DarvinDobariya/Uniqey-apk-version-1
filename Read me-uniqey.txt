hello,
    My APK name is UNIQEY. i decided to make this app for security purpose.
it is may possible that user need to make their data and conversation secure and secret. 
for that i try to solve this problem and i make one APK which is Decode user data or message and user can store those converted data at any where.

Use of this app is user can able to decode and encode their data and get those converted data. 
the use of this app two users can Communicate with hiden lenguage.

Special feture of this apk :
    UNIQEY app will encode your data or message into 1 uniq from of string and you can also decode those data and get orginal data or message.

    User interface of this app is simple to use. The user can able to past their data for decode and copy their converted data. 
User can decode and encode their data.

So this 1st version of my app. In next version, I will develop some time limit where user able to decode message within particular time, after they can't able to decode the message. 
And also ask password when user decode message 
and also user can able to store their data in application.

Dead line of data:
    The data may have their dead line for validation of an data. 
In case the user trying to decode their data after deadline that situation user can not get original data.

Password functionality:
In this functionality who's user know the right password of particular data those only user can get original data.

Store functionality :
User can store their data in form of file and take data at any time.
